    <p>
      I am a paid front end development intern for a small startup in Henderson, NV, which is near Las Vegas kind of like Hollywood is near L.A., except... it isn't like Hollywood or L.A. I started out becoming a graphic designer, but decided that I really liked developing websites so I kind of just turned the graphic design towards development and now do my best to create good looking web design.

      <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>

      <p>
        This is a great way to show statistics, percentage, and progress to users, and a technique that is becoming more popular with the increased use of CSS3 and HTML5. I'm looking forward to enhancing CSS and HTML skills, as well as some JavaScript with this component.
      </p>

      <h3>How does this relate to what have/will have learned in this class?</h3>

      <p>
        Flash used to be the standard for creating components like this, that can animate and have varied shapes based upon dynamic data, but it's now possible with HTML5 and CSS3, usually with the help of some JS, so I'm looking forward to creating this in a way that is dependent on the values from the HTML, or possibly some JSON.

      <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
      <p>
        I've created navigations and dropdown lists before, but never an extensive dropdown like this one. I'm thinking I'll be using either floating or inline-block styles for this.
      </p>
      <h3>How does this relate to what have/will have learned in this class?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm excited to create some interactive elements, and this nav and dropdown list will be a fun use of interactive CSS.

      <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
      <p>
        This is a bit heavier on the JS side, but making the correct use of HTML and CSS will be important as well. I'll be practicing with all three to create animated slides.
      </p>
      <h3>How does this relate to what have/will have learned in this class?</h3>
      <p>
        CSS3 can be used with JavaScript to create animations.
